 - Processed track data in the format: 0xF1 (track1 data), 0xF2 (track2 data) 0xF3 (track3 data). It is possible some of the tracks will be empty, then the identifier will not be present too, for example 0xF1 (track1 data) 0xF3 (track3 data)

/**
 Enables or disables Lines's capability to charge the handheld from it's own battery. Charging can stop if Linea's battery goes too low.
 
 <br>While Linea can act as external battery for the iPod/iPhone, there are certain limitations if you decide to implement it. The internal battery is not big enough, so if the iPod/iPhone consumes a lot of power from it, it will go down very fast and force the firmware to cut the charge to prevent going down to dangerous levels. The proper use of this charging function depends on how the program, running on the iPod/iPhone, is used and how the iPod/iPhone is discharged
 
 <br>There are two possible ways to use Linea's charge:
 - Emergency mode - in the case iPod/iPhone usage is designed in a way it will last long enough between charging sessions and using Linea's charge is not generally needed, the charge can be used if the iPod/iPhone for some reason goes too low (like <50%), so it is given some power to continue working until next charging. An example will be store, where devices are being charged every night, but extreme usage on some iPod drains the battery before the end of the shift.
 This is the less efficient way to charge it, also, Linea will refuse to start the charge if it's own battery goes below 3.8v, so depending on the usage, barcode type and if the barcode engine is set to work all the time, it may not be possible to start the charge.

 - Max life mode - it is the case where both devices are required to operate as long as possible. Usually, the iPod/iPhone's battery will be drained way faster than Linea's, especially with wifi enabled programs and to keep both devices operating as long as possible, the charging should be desinged in a way so iPod/iPhone is able to use most of Linea's battery. This is possible, if you start charging when iPod/iPhone is almost full - at around 75-80% or higher. This way the iPod will consume small amount of energy, allowing our battery to slowly be used almost fully to charge it.
 
 <br>LineaDemo application contains sample implementation of max life mode charging.

/** @defgroup G_LNCRYPTO Cryptographic & Security Functions
 Starting from firmware 2.13, Linea provides strong cryptographic support for magnetic card data. The encryption is supported on all Linea devices, from software point of view they are all the same, but provide different levels of hardware/firmware security.
 
 <br>An overview of the security, provided by Linea (see each of the crypto functions for further detail):
 
 <br>Hardware/Firmware: 
 
 <br>For magnetic card encryption Linea is using AES256, which is the current industry standard encryption algorithm. The encryption key resides in volatile, battery powered ram inside Linea's cpu (for Linea 1.5 onward) and is being lost if anyone tries to break in the Linea device in order to prevent the key from being stolen. Magnetic card data, along with device serial number and some random bytes (to ensure every packet will be different) are being sent to the iOS program in an encrypted way. 
 
 
 <br>Software: 

 <br>Currently there are 2 types of keys, that can be loaded into Linea: 
 - AUTHENTICATION KEY - used for device authentication (for example the program can lock itself to work with very specific Linea device) and encryption of the firmware 
 - ENCRYPTION KEY - used for magnetic card data encryption. To use msr encryption, you don't need to set the AUTHENTICATION KEY.
 
 <br>Keys: The keys can be set/changed in two ways: 

 <br>1. Using plain key data - this method is easy to use, but less secure, as it relies on program running on iPod/iPhone to have the key inside, an attacker could compromise the system and extract the key from device's memory. Call cryptoSetKey to set the keys this way. If there is an existing key of the same type inside Linea, you have to pass it too. 
 
 <br>2. Using encrypted key data - this method is harder to implement, but provides better security - the key data, encrypted with old key data is sent from a server in secure environment to the program, running on the iOS, then the program forwards it to the Linea. The program itself have no means to decrypt the data, so an attacker can't possibly extract the key. Refer to cryptoSetKey documentation for more detailed description of the loading process.
 
 <br>The initial loading of the keys should always be done in a secure environment. 
 
 <br>Magnetic card encryption:

 <br>Once ENCRYPTION KEY is set, all magnetic card data gets encrypted, and is now sent via magneticCardEncryptedData instead. The LineaDemo program contains sample code to decrypt the data block and extract the contents - the serial number and track data.
 
 <br>As with keys, card data can be extracted on the iOS device itself (less secure, the application needs to have the key inside) or be sent to a secure server to be processed. Note, that the encrypted data contains Linea's serial number too, this can be used for Data Origin Verification, to be sure someone is not trying to mimic data, coming from another device. 

 
 <br>Demo program: the sample program now have "Crypto" tab, where key management can be tested: 
 
 - New AES 256 key - type in the key you want to set (or change to) 
 - Old AES 256 key - type in the previous key, or leave blank if you set the key for the first time 
 
 <br>[SET AUTHENTICATION KEY] and [SET ENCRYPTION KEY] buttons allow you to use the key info in the text fields above to set the key. 
 
 - Decryption key - type in the key, which the demo program will use to try to decrypt card data. This field should contain the
 ENCRYPTION KEY, or something random, if you want to test failed card data decryption.

 <br>Used to store AES256 keys into Linea internal memory. Valid keys that can be set:
 - KEY_AUTHENTICATION - if set, you can use authentication functions - cryptoRawAuthenticateDevice
 or cryptoAuthenticateDevice. Firmware updates will require authentication too
 - KEY_ENCRYPTION - if set, magnetic card data will come encrypted via magneticCardEncryptedData or magneticCardEncryptedRawData

 <br>Generally the key loading process, using "Raw" commands, a program on the iOS device and a server which holds the keys will look similar to:
 
 - (iOS program) calls cryptoRawGenerateRandomData to get 16 bytes block of random data and send these to the server 
 - (Server) creates byte array of 48 bytes consisting of: [RANDOM DATA: 16 bytes][KEY DATA: 32 bytes] 
 - (Server) if there is current encryption key set on the Linea (if you want to change existing key) the server encrypts the 48 bytes block with the OLD key 
 - (Server) sends the result data back to the program 
 - (iOS program) calls cryptoRawSetKey with KEY_ENCRYPTION and the data it received from the server
 - (Linea) tries to decrypt the key data if there was already key present, then extracts the key, verifies the random data and if everything is okay, sets the key 
 @param keyID the key type to set - KEY_AUTHENTICATION or KEY_ENCRYPTION
 @param encryptedData - 48 bytes that consists of 16 bytes random numbers received via call to cryptoRawGenerateRandomData and 32 byte AES256 key. If there has been previous key of the same type, then all 48 bytes should be encrypted with it.
 @param keyVersion - the version of the key. On firmware versions less than 2.43 this parameter is ignored and key version is considered to be 0x00000000. Key version is useful for the program to determine what key is inside the head.

-(BOOL)getCharging;

/**
 Enables or disables Lines's capability to charge the handheld from it's own battery. Charging can stop if Linea's battery goes too low.
 When enabling or disabling the charge linea will force disconnect and reconnect.
 
 <br>While Linea can act as external battery for the iPod/iPhone, there are certain limitations if you decide to implement it. The internal battery is
 not big enough, so if the iPod/iPhone consumes a lot of power from it, it will go down very fast and force the firmware to cut the charge to prevent
 going down to dangerous levels. The proper use of this charging function depends on how the program, running on the iPod/iPhone, is used and how the
 iPod/iPhone is discharged
 
 <br>There are two possible ways to use Linea's charge:
 - Emergency mode - in the case iPod/iPhone usage is designed in a way it will last long enough between charging sessions and using Linea's charge
 is not generally needed, the charge can be used if the iPod/iPhone for some reason goes too low (like <50%), so it is given some power to continue
 working until next charging. An example will be store, where devices are being charged every night, but extreme usage on some iPod drains
 the battery before the end of the shift.
 This is the less efficient way to charge it, also, Linea will refuse to start the charge if it's own battery goes below 3.8v, so depending on the usage,
 barcode type and if the barcode engine is set to work all the time, it may not be possible to start the charge.
 
 - Max life mode - it is the case where both devices are required to operate as long as possible. Usually, the iPod/iPhone's battery will be drained
 way faster than Linea's, especially with wifi enabled programs and to keep both devices operating as long as possible, the charging should
 be desinged in a way so iPod/iPhone is able to use most of Linea's battery. This is possible, if you start charging when iPod/iPhone is almost full - at around
 75-80% or higher. This way the iPod will consume small amount of energy, allowing our battery to slowly be used almost
 fully to charge it.
 
 <br>LineaDemo application contains sample implementation of max life mode charging.

/** @defgroup G_DEP_LNCRYPTO Deprecated Cryptographic & Security Functions
 Starting from firmware 2.13, Linea provides strong cryptographic support for magnetic card data. The encryption is supported
 on all Linea devices, from software point of view they are all the same, but provide different levels of hardware/firmware security.
 
 <br>An overview of the security, provided by Linea (see each of the crypto functions for further detail):
 
 <br>Hardware/Firmware: 
 
 <br>For magnetic card encryption Linea is using AES256, which is the current industry standard encryption algorithm. The encryption key
 resides in volatile, battery powered ram inside Linea's cpu (for Linea 1.5 onward) and is being lost if anyone tries to break in the
 Linea device in order to prevent the key from being stolen. Magnetic card data, along with device serial number and some random bytes
 (to ensure every packet will be different) are being sent to the iOS program in an encrypted way. 
 
 
 <br>Software: 
 
 <br>Currently there are 2 types of keys, that can be loaded into Linea: 
 - AUTHENTICATION KEY - used for device authentication (for example the program can lock itself to work with very specific Linea device)
 and encryption of the firmware 
 - ENCRYPTION KEY - used for magnetic card data encryption. To use msr encryption, you don't need to set the AUTHENTICATION KEY. 
 
 <br>Keys: The keys can be set/changed in two ways: 
 
 <br>1. Using plain key data - this method is easy to use, but less secure, as it relies on program running on iPod/iPhone to have the key
 inside, an attacker could compromise the system and extract the key from device's memory. Call cryptoSetKey to set the keys this way.
 If there is an existing key of the same type inside Linea, you have to pass it too. 
 
 <br>2. Using encrypted key data - this method is harder to implement, but provides better security - the key data, encrypted with old key
 data is sent from a server in secure environment to the program, running on the iOS, then the program forwards it to the Linea.
 The program itself have no means to decrypt the data, so an attacker can't possibly extract the key. Refer to cryptoSetKey documentation
 for more detailed description of the loading process.
 
 <br>The initial loading of the keys should always be done in a secure environment. 
 
 <br>Magnetic card encryption:
 
 <br>Once ENCRYPTION KEY is set, all magnetic card data gets encrypted, and is now sent via magneticCardEncryptedData instead. The LineaDemo
 program contains sample code to decrypt the data block and extract the contents - the serial number and track data.
 
 <br>As with keys, card data can be extracted on the iOS device itself (less secure, the application needs to have the key inside) or be sent
 to a secure server to be processed. Note, that the encrypted data contains Linea's serial number too, this can be used for Data Origin
 Verification, to be sure someone is not trying to mimic data, coming from another device. 
 
 
 <br>Demo program: the sample program now have "Encryption" tab, where key management can be tested: 
 
 - New AES 256 key - type in the key you want to set (or change to) 
 - Old AES 256 key - type in the previous key, or leave blank if you set the key for the first time 
 
 <br>[SET AUTHENTICATION KEY] and [SET ENCRYPTION KEY] buttons allow you to use the key info in the text fields above to set the key. 
 
 - Decryption key - type in the key, which the demo program will use to try to decrypt card data. This field should contain the
 ENCRYPTION KEY, or something random, if you want to test failed card data decryption.
